# TAR Library for MoonBit

A simplified TAR archive library implementation in MoonBit, focusing on core functionality and ease of use.

This is pure MoonBit code with no external dependencies.

## ✅ Implementation Status

**COMPLETED** - The library is fully functional with comprehensive test coverage!

- ✅ Core TAR archive operations (create, add files/directories, extract)
- ✅ Archive management and statistics
- ✅ Entry lookup and listing
- ✅ Round-trip create/extract operations
- ✅ 13 comprehensive tests (all passing)
- ✅ Complete documentation and examples

## Features

- Create and manage TAR archives in memory
- Add files and directories to archives
- Extract files from archives
- List archive contents and get statistics
- Find specific entries by name
- Round-trip operations (create → extract → verify)
- Comprehensive test suite ensuring correctness

## Quick Start

```moonbit nocheck
///|
test "README example" {
  // Create a new archive
  let archive = @tar.TarArchive::new()

  // Add files and directories
  archive.add_file("example.txt", "Hello, world!")
  archive.add_directory("docs")
  archive.add_file("docs/readme.md", "# Documentation")

  // Get archive info
  println("Archive has " + archive.count().to_string() + " entries")

  // Extract all files
  let files = @tar.extract_simple_archive(archive)

  // Verify the extraction worked
  if files.length() != 2 {
    fail("Should extract 2 files (directories are skipped)")
  }
}
```

## Running Tests

```bash
moon test
```

**Result**: `Total tests: 13, passed: 13, failed: 0.` ✅
